This guide provides security and privacy practices to address both digital and physical surveillance. It offers resources and recommendations for individuals and groups to protect themselves against a range of modern surveillance tactics. First, I will provide Privacy and security (Physical Countermeasures) and later on I will publish Privacy and security (Cybersecurity Countermeasures). 

# Privacy and security (Physical Countermeasures)

# 1.Privacy and security, against advanced surveillance tactics employed by military or intelligence agencies or law enforcement agencies. 
## 1. EMP Shielding What it is:
• EMP (Electromagnetic Pulse) shielding protects sensitive electronic equipment from high-energy electromagnetic bursts, which could be used in attacks to disable or destroy electronics.
Why it's important:
• EMP attacks can be used to damage or disrupt critical infrastructure, such as communications, data storage, and security systems.
• Shielding sensitive electronic equipment ensures continuity of operations and protects valuable data from being erased or corrupted.
How it's done:
• Equipment is housed in conductive materials (Faraday cages) that block the electromagnetic waves.
• Shielded enclosures are built using specialized conductive materials, which redirect and dissipate electromagnetic energy.

## Lists

Create an unordered list by starting each item with a `-`, `+`, or `*`.

- Item 1
- Item 2
    - Subitem 2.1
    - Subitem 2.2

### Ordered List
Create an ordered list by starting with numbers.

## Links

To add a hyperlink, use square brackets for the text, followed by the link in parentheses.
